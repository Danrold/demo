# Demo
Repository for test app (LiderIT)

To deploy the application to your computer, repeat the following steps in sequence:


0. Make sure you have JDK 1.8+ installed and a local PostgreSQL server running
1. Download the code using the git client or as a .zip archive
2. Using a PostreSQL client create an empty database.
3. Edit the application.properties file specifying your database and also the postgres username and password
4. You can compile and run the code yourself. For example, you have an IDE installed, where it will be very easy to start a project. Alternatively, you can use the gradle wrapper command - gradlew bootRun
5. Alternatively, you can run the finished JAR file. Hope it works

The project will also be deployed on free Heroku hosting. You will have access to the GUI documentation from swagger-ui
